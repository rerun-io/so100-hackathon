"""Realtime SO-100 telemetry + cameras + animated URDF -> Rerun.

Python port of rerun-io/portugal's log_v2 + robot.rs + camera.rs, plus the
dual-arm pattern from rerun's examples/python/animated_urdf.

Default: auto-detect every plugged-in arm and camera, spawn a viewer, and
stream live. Pass ``--rr-config.save out.rrd`` to also write the recording
(dual-sink). In a shell with no display, pass ``--rr-config.headless`` so the
viewer spawn doesn't wedge logging.

    pixi run log-so100 --fps 30 --cameras 1 2 --rr-config.save session.rrd

Lives in the package (not the ``tools/`` shim) so ``beartype_this_package()``
type-checks ``main`` and the config when running under the dev environment.
