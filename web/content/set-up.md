## Install

Everything runs through [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) — install it first if you don't have it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

Then clone the repo and install the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rerun-io/so100-hackathon.git
cd so100-hackathon
pixi install
```

That's it — every command in this dataset loop is a `pixi run ...` task from the repo root. Every step on this page runs in the embedded [Rerun](https://rerun.io/) viewer.

<p>Prefer doing everything from the terminal without this site? The repo's `README.md` is a
compressed, CLI-only version of exactly these steps.</p>

## First: Start the local data server

One process owns all your data today: it stores every episode and makes it queryable — powered by [Rerun](https://rerun.io/)'s open-source server. In a terminal at the repo root:

```bash
pixi run so100-server
```

Leave it running for the rest of the day. It hosts:

* a live stream this site's embedded viewers connect to (port 9876)
* a catalog of all your recordings (port 51234)
* a small control API that powers the buttons on this page and the Collect page (port 8000)

It does
**not** hold the arms — the serial ports stay free, so the setup tools below (and your own
terminal runs) can grab them anytime.


## Set up your SO-100 arms

If you've worked with SO-100 arms before you know they should be calibrated before using
them to collect data. The card below walks you through it in three steps, all sharing one
embedded [Rerun](https://rerun.io) viewer — only one tool runs at a time:

1. **Ping** — see if your machine recognizes the arms at all.
2. **Calibrate** — walk through calibration, leader arm then follower.
3. **Verify teleop** — test that teleoperation works as expected.

Prefer the terminal? The same four tools, in order:

```bash
pixi run so100-server              # the local data server (keep it running)
pixi run log-so100                 # ping: stream live arm telemetry
pixi run calibrate-so100 leader    # calibrate the leader
pixi run calibrate-so100 follower  # calibrate the follower
pixi run teleop-so100              # verify teleop: follower mirrors the leader
```
